This repo contains the code and report for Data Analysis and Machine Learning (FYS-STK3155), Project 1.
We study polynomial regression on the Runge function using OLS, Ridge, and LASSO, plus full-batch and stochastic optimizers. We also reproduce bias–variance curves using bootstrap and K-fold resampling.
