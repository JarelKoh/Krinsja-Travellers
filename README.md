This repository contains the code and report for Data Analysis and Machine Learning (FYS-STK3155), Project 1.
We study polynomial regression on the Runge function using OLS, Ridge, and LASSO, plus full-batch and stochastic optimizers. We also reproduce bias–variance curves using bootstrap and K-fold resampling.

You may find our final report for project 1 as well as the jupyter notebook code file we used in the folder titled 'Project 1'.
